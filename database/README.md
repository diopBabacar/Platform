Data model
=======
IoT-Lite
-----------
IoT lite is a lightweight data model based on semantic sensor network (SSN) ontology . This ontology describes IoT concepts that allow interoperability and discovery of sensory data in heterogeneous IoT platforms. IoT-lite reduces the complexity of other IoT models describing only the main concepts of the IoT domain. Moreover, IoT-Lite can be extended by different models to increment its expressiveness.

The figure below depicts the key concepts of the ontology and the main relationships between them.
